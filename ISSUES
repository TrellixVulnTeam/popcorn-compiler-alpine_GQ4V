------------------------
Known compilation issues
------------------------

- Additionally, OpenMP symbols for outlined functions are known to not align
  (due to clashing symbol names across binaries) but shouldn't cause issues,
  e.g., ".omp_outlined."

- Stackmaps in the migration library in "__migrate_shim_internal" have
  different numbers of location records

- Because ".omp_outlined.*" functions cannot be aligned, the stackmap-checking
  tool will complain that stackmaps in those functions refer to different
  functions

- The toolchain compiles to LLVM bitcode with the aarch64 target because all IR
  generated for that target will also correctly codegen for x86-64 (whereas the
  reverse is not true).  However, when compiling using the x86-64 backend clang
  will complain about the aarch64-specific feature "neon"

--------------------
Known runtime issues
--------------------

- Functions declared with __attribute__((destructor)) may not work correctly,
  and may cause the application to segfault when exiting

- TODO Pointers to the stack embedded in structs
