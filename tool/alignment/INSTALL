This enables the given target application to be properly aligne when
compiling the target application into a heterogeneous-ISA executable
for Popcorn Linux.

1. Build and install Alignment Component

  $ make
  $ make install

2. Modify scripts/mlink_x86Objs.sh
	  scripts/mlink_armObjs.sh

  such that the variable "POPCORN" is the absolute path of the
install directory of the popcorn toolchain
(default is : POPCORN="/usr/local/popcorn")
