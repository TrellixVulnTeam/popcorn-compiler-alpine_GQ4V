Template makefile usage
-----------------------

- The default template to use is Makefile.pyalign.template, it should be copied
  it in your sources folder and renamed as 'Makefile'
- The MODE variable is defining the target architectures pair, it can take the
  following values:
	- arm (for x86-64/aarch64 migration)
	- ppc (for x86-64/powerpc64 migration)

Example:

make MODE=ppc
