This patch is for binutils' gold ld linker, v2.27.  It achieves two things:

1. Adjusts aarch64's TLS layout to conform to x86-64's layout
2. Print detailed size and alignment information for all data/function symbols
   in the generated binaries.

# TODO add information about how the layout is changed, i.e., is it inverted?
