Installing libbomp
------------------

The libbomp library is needed in order to enable multi-threading
within target applications compiled for Heterogeneous Popcorn Linux.
Therefore this library needs to be compiled for all architectures where
taking advantage of parallelism is desired.

NOTE: libbomp is also built using the CFLAGS (-ffunction-sections, 
-fdata-sections, and -fno-common) enabling each symbol to be within it's
own section and therefore able to be aligned by the alignment tool
during compilation.

Assumptions:
	Libbomp is built using Clang and assumes you have clang installed.

1. Build & Install libbomp for each ISA (currently x86-64 and aarch64 ONLY)

  $ make
  $ make install

This builds both versions of the library and places them in the $(POPCORN)/lib
directory to be linked in during compilation.

libbomp_x86-64.a: The x86-64 version of the library to be used with the
	x86 part of the heterogeneous executables
libbomp_aarch64.a: The ARM64 version of the library to be used with the
	ARM part of the heterogeneous executables
