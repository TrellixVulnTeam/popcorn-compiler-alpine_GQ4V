1. Futex is currently not enabled on Popcorn.  We need to implement/test the
   following for correctness:

  __wake()
  pthread_barrier_wait()
  pthread_cond_timedwait()
  __timedwait_cp()
  __wait()

2. Need to walk the assembly files contained in the src directory to put
   functions in their own sections for alignment (e.g., see
   "src/string/x86_64/memmove.s")

  - Do for aarch64, powerpc64 & x86_64
