Implementation
--------------

1. How do we find pointers to the stack for pointers in arrays or structs?

2. Handle variable-sized stack objects

3. Add constructor/destructor attributes to __st_userspace_ctr,
   __st_userspace_dtor & __st_destroy, make them static

4. Implement correct error handling/reporting

5. Do we need the unwind information address range section?  We currently use
   it to look up functions by PC (needed when bootstrapping) but we don't need
   the unwinding offset information.
